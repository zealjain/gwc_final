          <p>Fruitful is an organization where you can share freshly grown fruit and vegtables with people in your local community. Users can easily spread the word about their fruits or vegtables and find free produce in their areas. We value community and sharing, and hope that this platform allows people to become better acquainted with their neighbors and develop a stronger sense of community in their neighborhoods while reducing food waste. This program was started by a group of motivated high school students commmitted to making a change in their community. Now, we hope to encourage more people to garden and get the nutrition of home grown foods rather than ones that you find in the stores. </p>
