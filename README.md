Zeal, Michelle, Surabhi, Dhriti, and Julianne's GWC Final Project: Fruitful

Fruitful is a platform that allows neighbors to share their fresh fruits and vegetables. Users can easily spread the word about their gardens or fruit trees by creating a post on our site. Users can also easily find fruit in their area by viewing all of the produce nearest to them on a map.

To post, navigate to the post page and fill out the form with the corresponding information. Once you click the "Post" button, the information you entered with by displayed as a marker on the map in the pick page for others to see. 

To find fruit in your area, navigate to the pick page and type in your address in the map. If you zoom out, you will be able to see all of the fruits and vegetables nearest to you and all the contact information and special instructions you will need. 

Currently, you cannot create an account on our site however we are working on this feature. If you navigate to the Sign In page you will be able to see the styling of the page and how an account page and sign up form would look.
