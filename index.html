          <p>Fruitful is an organization where you can share fruit with people in your local community. We value community and sharing, and believe that with this organization people can become better aqquainted with their neighbors promoting a greater sense of community all over the world. This program was started by a group of high school students commmitted to making a change in their community. Now, we hope to promote more people to garden and get the nutrition of home grown foods rather than ones that you find in the stores. </p>
